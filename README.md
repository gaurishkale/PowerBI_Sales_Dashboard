📊 Power BI Project: Sales Dashboard
I’m thrilled to share my latest Power BI project—a Sales Dashboard that provides key insights into revenue, profit, orders, and product performance! 🚀
🔍 Project Overview: This dashboard is designed to analyze sales trends, monitor business performance, and help make data-driven decisions effectively.
🛠 Steps Involved:
1️⃣ Data Collection & Power Query Transformation Imported sales data from Excel, SQL Server, and other sources. Cleaned and transformed data using Power Query:
✅ Removed duplicates & handled missing values.
✅ Changed data types for accuracy.
✅ Merged and appended tables for a structured data model.
2️⃣ Data Modeling & Relationships Established relationships between tables: Sales, Products, Customers, Calendar, etc. Optimized data schema using Star Schema for better performance.
3️⃣ DAX Measures & Calculations
Created DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to derive key insights:
✅ Total Revenue: Total Revenue = SUM(Sales[Revenue])
✅ Total Profit: Total Profit = SUM(Sales[Profit])
✅ Total Orders: Total Orders = DISTINCTCOUNT(Sales[OrderID])
✅ Top 5 Subcategories by Revenue using TOPN() and RANKX()
✅ Cumulative Sales Trend with CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Revenue]), DATESYTD(Calendar[Date]))
4️⃣ Dashboard Design & Visualization
Built interactive visualizations using bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and maps. Included key metrics:
✅ Sales Trend Over Years
✅ Category-wise & Subcategory-wise Profit
✅ Geographic Revenue Distribution
5️⃣ Interactivity & User Experience
Added slicers & filters for Year, Month, Country, Product Category to allow dynamic analysis. 💡 Key Insights & Business Impact
✅ Identified best-selling products & top revenue-generating regions.
✅ Tracked revenue growth over the years.
✅ Helped businesses analyze profitability and customer trends.
